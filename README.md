Aside from the initial GhostProxies.com shutdown in 2019, GhostProxies.com was shut down again after a temporary service disruption from an automated cryptocurrency mining prevention action from verifying too many proxy connections at once with SHA1 on a free-tier VM instance.

This is a public archive of the files from GhostProxies.com as-is. There was no commercial gain from operating GhostProxies.com using the pure JavaScript and PHP files in this repository without framework dependencies.

GhostProxies.com is unaffiliated with GhostProxies.io and all other mentions of "GhostProxies".

Some of the files in this repository may be either modified versions or out-of-date versions of the original files.

The creator of GhostProxies.com is redirecting efforts to a product-based website focused on creating [minimal video games](https://williamstaffordparsons.github.io/#games) and conducting [game engine research](https://williamstaffordparsons.github.io/#research).
